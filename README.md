# Home monitoring _(but in a box)_

## About
This project is created for the _Robotics_ course at FMI.

It uses sensors to measure values across a _room_ and notify the user if any goes out of limits.

## Hardware
The microprocessor board used is an _Arduino Mega_, but any _Arduino_ compatible board with enough pins will do the job.

Sensors
* Reed switch - for doors
* HC-SR501 - pir sensors for detecting movement
* MC-3 - gas sensor for detecting smoke and gas
* DHT-11 - temperature and humidity sensor
* LCD screen
